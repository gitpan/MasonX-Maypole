=head2 maybe_link_view

C<maybe_link_view> takes something returned from the database - either
some ordinary data, or an object in a related class expanded by a
has-a relationship. If it is an object, it constructs a link to the view
command for that object. Otherwise, it just displays the data.

This tests whether or not the returned value is an object, and if so,
creates a link to a page viewing that object; if not, it just displays
the text as normal. The object is linked using its stringified name;
by default this calls the C<name> method, or returns the object's ID
if there is no C<name> method or other stringification method defined.
