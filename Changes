Revision history for MasonX-Maypole

Change log
==========

0.220  Web Apr  7, 03:20:00 2005
    - fixed a couple of bugs in maybe_link_view template
    - edited header template to place maypole.css in /css
    - updated example httpd.conf and BeerDB.pm

0.219  Sun Feb 20, 18:03:00 2005
    - changed send_output() to add a component root based on the model moniker, rather 
        than the table name. In most cases these will be identical. 
    - fixed a bug where all custom component roots were compiled in the same subdirectory 
        of the Mason data dir, thus breaking the ability of different versions of the 
        same template to be called for different tables (mreece). Can't figure out why 
        this never affected me, since it's pretty fundamental to the whole thing. 

0.218  Tues Feb 15, 15:40:00 2005
    - fixed bug in search_form template ($element->{tag} should be $element->tag)

0.217  Fri  Feb 11, 11:55:00 2005
    - fixed links in frontpage template 

0.216  Thur Feb 10, 22:30:00 2005
