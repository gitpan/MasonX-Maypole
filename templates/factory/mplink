=head2 mplink

This creates a link to a command in the Maypole app by
catenating the base URL, table, command, and any arguments.

Note that the format of these links should match that parsed by the
C<parse_path> method found somewhere in your Maypole hierarchy (e.g. in
C<MasonX::Maypole>). 

p.s. This is called C<mplink> because it's reasonably
likely that people will already have their own link-generating
component called C<link> in a shared component root.
